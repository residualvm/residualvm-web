					Since our last update, there has been a quite a bit of development, 340 bugs
					have been fixed in our <a href="https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/issues">issue-tracker</a>, and although
					quite a few still remain, development continues. Those interested in a bit more detail, can take a look at
					<i>giucam</i>'s <a href="http://lostsoulsalliance.wordpress.com/">blog</a>
				</p>
				<p>
				One of the more interesting bugs found and solved, was the one about <a href="http://residual.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=108">missing dialogue</a>
						in Year 3, which actually was as old as <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TimOfLegend/status/136970659535400960">the original game.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					On another note, our forums has had an interesting turn of events, quite a few of
					the members have joined together to work on improving the original graphics of the
					game in a project called <a href="http://residual.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=100">Grim Fandango: Remastered</a>
					<i>JohnnyWalker2001</i> has set up a <a href="http://grimfandangodeluxe.blogspot.com/">blog</a> where updates
					on this effort are posted.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Grim Fandango</i> support still remains in active development, and a little bit of work has been
					done on <i>Escape From Monkey Island</i>. Now you can atleast play the intro video in the demo. Still, no promises on the
					EFMI improving any more any time soon.
				</p>
				<p>
					As always, any contribution is greatly appreciated. If you wish to help, we can be contacted on #residual (freenode), or in our <a href="http://residual.scummvm.org/">forums</a>.
